{/* migrated from range42/GETTING_STARTED.md "Walkthrough - wizard steps" */}

For each step you'll see:
- **What you do** — what to enter / click
- **Behind the scenes** — what the wizard does on your machine and on Proxmox

## Step 0 — Clone the main repo

You only need the `range42` repo locally — it contains the wizard. The wizard
itself will clone the rest (playbooks, catalog, controller, devkit) on the
deployer-cli during deploy.

```bash
sudo apt-get update ; apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install python3-venv git
mkdir -p $HOME/range42 && cd $HOME/range42
git clone https://github.com/range42/range42.git
```

:::tip Recommended

Keep the default paths (`$HOME/range42` for git repos, `$HOME/range42.config`
for workspaces). The wizard offers to change them if you really need to, but
the defaults are well-tested and many scripts / configs reference them.
**This is the only structural constraint** — the rest of the wizard is fully
configurable.

:::

## Step 1 — Launch the wizard (preflight)

```bash
cd ~/range42/range42
./range42-init.py
```

**What you do:** wait for the preflight checks. If anything is missing,
the wizard offers to install it (textual, ansible, sshpass, keychain).

**Behind the scenes:**
- Checks `which ansible ssh-keygen ssh-agent sshpass git keychain zsh`
- Checks Ansible collections: `community.crypto`, `community.general`
- Checks if `inventories/example/` exists
- Checks ssh-agent is running

If anything is missing, the wizard either auto-installs (apt) or shows the
fix command for you to run manually.

## Step 1b — Confirm install paths

**What you do:** review the install paths and confirm.

The wizard asks where to put two things:
- **range42 git repos** → default: `$HOME/range42/`
- **range42 workspaces** (per-codename configs, secrets, SSH keys) → default: `$HOME/range42.config/`

Recommended: keep the defaults. Changing them is possible but it is one of
the **rare elements we recommend not to modify** — many internal scripts,
templates and helper functions reference these paths, and a non-default layout
can make troubleshooting harder.

**Behind the scenes:**
- The chosen paths are stored in the wizard config and propagated to:
  - `inventories/<codename>/group_vars/all/vars.yml`
  - `~/range42.config/<codename>-<scenario>/sourced_range42.sh`
  - SSH config templates, vault paths, devkit scripts

## Step 2 — Choose new or existing

What you see at this step depends on whether you've already deployed range42 on this machine.

**First-time setup** — no previous configuration is detected, the wizard goes straight to "new".

**Subsequent runs** — at least one previous configuration exists, the wizard offers a choice.

**What you do:** first-time setup → nothing to pick, just continue. If you already deployed a config, you'll see it listed and can either start a new one or overwrite an existing one.

**Behind the scenes:**
- Scans `inventories/` for existing setups (folders with `hosts.yml`)
- For each, parses `group_vars/` to detect deployed scenarios
- Shows one button per `codename + scenario` combination, plus `◆ new`

If you pick "new", an empty inventory will be created. If you pick an existing one, the wizard pre-fills all fields from `group_vars/all/vars.yml`.

## Step 3 — Enter your infrastructure codename

**What you do:** pick a label for your Proxmox infrastructure (e.g., `mylab`).
This becomes the namespace for everything related to this Proxmox.

**Behind the scenes:**
- Will create `inventories/<codename>/` from `inventories/example/` template
- All subsequent files (vault, SSH keys, workspace) are scoped under this codename

## Step 4 — Proxmox connection details

**What you do:**
- **Address**: IP or hostname of your Proxmox (e.g., `192.168.1.10`)
- **Node**: Proxmox node name (see below)

### The PVE node name must be exact

The wizard asks for the **Proxmox node name**. This is **not** a label you choose — it must match exactly the node name as it appears in the Proxmox web UI / API. Often it's `pve` on a single-node setup, but it can also be `pve01`, the hostname, or anything the cluster admin set.

You can find the exact name in the Proxmox web console (left sidebar tree, the entry under "Datacenter") or via SSH on the Proxmox host:

```bash
pvesh get /nodes --output-format json | jq -r '.[].node'
```

If the name doesn't match exactly, the wizard's API calls will fail at Step 4 validation (or later at deploy time on `vm_create`).

**Behind the scenes:**
- Tests HTTPS reachability to `https://<address>:8006`
- Validates the node name exists in Proxmox API (`GET /nodes`)

No changes are made yet — this is read-only verification.

### Proxmox root password

The wizard then prompts for the Proxmox **root password**.

**What it's used for:**
- Install the range42 root SSH key in `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` (one-shot, via `sshpass`)
- Create the `jump_user` Linux account on Proxmox
- Create the `range42_api` PAM user + API token via `pveum`
- Configure Proxmox locale, NTP, IP forwarding, network bridges (`vmbr140-148`), NAT rules

After this bootstrap, root SSH is no longer used — daily operations go through the `jump_user` and the API token (see [Why a `jump_user` and not just root?](#why-a-jump_user-and-not-just-root) below).

**Privacy note:** the password is held in memory by the wizard for the duration of the run and never written to disk.

### Deployer-cli sudo password

The wizard also prompts for the **sudo password on the deployer-cli** (your local machine in the default setup).

**What it's used for:**
- `apt install` packages required by the deployer-cli role (ansible, git, keychain, zsh, sshpass, etc.)
- Install dotfiles and configure system services (locale, NTP)
- Write SSH config under `~/.ssh/` (no sudo strictly needed for `~/.ssh`, but other steps in the role need it)

If the deployer-cli is your local machine (the default), this is your own sudo password. If you target a remote deployer-cli VM, this is the sudo password of the user on that VM.

## Step 5 — Network (NAT auto-detect + bridge toggles)

**What you do:**
- The wizard auto-detects your outbound NAT interface (typically `vmbr0`)
- Bridges `vmbr140` to `vmbr148` are listed with a NAT toggle each
- Defaults are fine — accept

### Disable outgoing NAT on a specific bridge

If you want to **isolate one or several subnets from internet access**, just click on the corresponding bridge in the list to toggle off its outgoing NAT.

This is useful for fully air-gapped subnets (e.g., a sensitive forensic VM, an offline analysis lab) — VMs on a NAT-disabled bridge can still talk to other VMs on the same subnet, but cannot reach the internet through the Proxmox host.

### Why bridges are pre-created

By default, range42 **pre-creates all the bridges listed in the wizard** (`vmbr140` to `vmbr148`) on the Proxmox host as part of this step, even if your scenario only uses a few of them.

**Why:** it saves time on later deployments. Once the bridges exist, deploying any scenario (or adding a new one with more subnets) requires no Proxmox network reconfiguration — the wizard just clones VMs onto the already-existing bridges. The cost is minimal: an unused bridge is just a Linux interface with no traffic.

**Behind the scenes:**
- SSH to Proxmox as root, runs `ip route get 1.1.1.1 | awk '{print $5}'`
- Identifies outbound interface (typically `vmbr0`)
- Creates the `vmbr140-148` bridges via `pvesh create /nodes/<node>/network` (idempotent — skipped if already present)
- Injects per-bridge NAT rules (post-up/post-down iptables MASQUERADE) for bridges with NAT enabled
- Reloads Proxmox network config (`ifreload -a`)
- Stores in inventory:
  - `infrastructure_proxmox_default_network_card_interface: vmbr0`
  - Per-bridge `nat: true/false` toggle

## Step 6 — Pick scenario

**What you do:** type `blank_scenario_2_subnets`.

**Behind the scenes:**
- Stored as `INFRASTRUCTURE_SCENARIO` in `group_vars/all/vars.yml`
- Determines which J2 templates the deploy will use

## Step 7 — Deployer + auto-deploy

This step asks **where** the deployer-cli will run (location + user) and then launches the full deployment. The two passwords (Proxmox root + deployer-cli sudo) were already collected at [Step 4](#step-4--proxmox-connection-details).

### Deployer-cli location (IP)

**What you do:** enter the IP / hostname where the deployer-cli will be configured.

**By default, range42 deploys the deployer-cli on the same machine where you run the wizard** — so the default value is `127.0.0.1`. Most users keep this.

If you want a dedicated deployer-cli VM (e.g., to manage multiple Proxmox infrastructures from one place, or to keep credentials off your laptop), enter that VM's IP instead. The VM must already exist and be reachable over SSH.

### Deployer-cli user

**What you do:** enter the Linux user that will own the workspace on the deployer-cli.

If you kept `127.0.0.1` above, this is your current local user (typically what `whoami` returns). On a dedicated deployer-cli VM, this is the user that will hold `~/range42/`, `~/range42.config/`, `~/.ssh/range42/`, etc.

The user must:
- Already exist on the deployer-cli machine
- Have sudo rights (for the apt installs in Playbook 03)
- Be reachable over SSH from the wizard machine (only if you target a remote deployer-cli)

### Confirm and trigger the deployer-cli install

This is the **last interactive prompt** — the wizard shows a recap of everything it's about to do (Proxmox address, codename, scenario, deployer-cli location/user, network bridges) and asks you to confirm before any change is made on Proxmox or on the deployer-cli.

**What you do:** review the recap, then confirm to launch the install.

Up to here the wizard has only been **collecting input and doing read-only checks** (HTTPS reachability, node name validation). The moment you confirm, the wizard starts making real changes — installing SSH keys on Proxmox, creating the jump\_user, generating the API token, writing the vault, configuring the deployer-cli. This is your last opportunity to abort cleanly.

If you abort here (Ctrl-C or "Cancel"), nothing has been touched on Proxmox or on the deployer-cli yet — your input is just discarded.

### Auto-deploy starts

After confirming, the wizard runs the full deployment automatically (~10–15 min).

**Behind the scenes:** the wizard runs `ansible-playbook site.yml` which executes 3 playbooks in sequence.

### Playbook 01 — credentials.generate

**Local actions:**
- Generate 4 SSH keypairs (ed25519) in `config/<codename>-<scenario>/ssh_keys/`:
  - `px.<codename>-<scenario>-ssh_cli.root` — Proxmox root SSH
  - `px.<codename>-<scenario>-ssh_cli.jump_user` — Proxmox jump user SSH
  - `r42.<codename>-<scenario>-deployer-key_alice` — admin user on VMs
  - `r42.<codename>-<scenario>-student-key_bob` — student user on VMs
- Generate vault with random VM passwords + Wazuh password
- Encrypt vault with `vault_pass.txt`
- Generate operator's SSH config snippet

### Playbook 02 — configure proxmox

**Proxmox actions (via root SSH using password from wizard):**
- Install the root SSH key in `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`
- Create `jump_user` Linux user
- Install Linux locale (en\_US.UTF-8)
- Configure NTP

**Proxmox actions (via API token, then via root SSH):**
- Create `range42_api` PAM user
- Generate `range42_api_token` token (auto-recovers if exists with wrong secret)
- Inject token secret into vault
- Create bridges `vmbr140` to `vmbr148` via `pvesh`
- Inject NAT rules per bridge (post-up/post-down iptables MASQUERADE)
- Reload Proxmox network (`ifreload -a`)
- Enable IP forwarding

#### Why a `jump_user` and not just root?

You'll notice range42 creates a separate `jump_user` Linux account on Proxmox,
even though it already installed the root SSH key. Two reasons:

1. **Separation of concerns.** Root is used **only once** during bootstrap
   (install the root key, create the jump user, set the API token). After that,
   day-to-day operations (`range42-context use`, `ssh r42.<vm>`) use the API token
   and `jump_user`. Root SSH is no longer needed.

2. **Reduced attack surface for ProxyJump.** A SSH connection through a `jump_user`
   only needs to forward TCP to the internal subnets — it doesn't need a shell.
   Even if the jump key leaks, the attacker has no shell on Proxmox (you can lock
   the user down further with `ForceCommand` or restricted shell if desired).

   Honestly, this doesn't add a huge amount of security on its own — the `jump_user`
   on Proxmox is still a Linux account. But it's a good hygiene practice and lets
   you rotate the jump key without touching root.

### Playbook 03 — deploy deployer-cli

**Deployer-cli actions (via SSH from your local machine):**
- Install packages: `ansible`, `git`, `keychain`, `oh-my-zsh`, `zsh`, `vim`, etc.
- Configure NTP and locale
- Install dotfiles (vim, zsh)
- Clone all 5 range42 repos to `~/range42/` (see table below)
- Create workspace at `~/range42.config/<codename>-<scenario>/`
- Upload SSH keys + vault from local machine
- Create symlinks: `scenario →` (in workspace), `secrets →` (in playbook scenario dir)
- Generate two SSH config files from J2 templates:
  - `~/.ssh/config` — adds `Include` for the next file
  - `~/.ssh/config_range42-<codename>-<scenario>` — actual host entries
- Inject `source ~/range42.config/range42-context.sh` into `.zshrc`
- Set the active context to this codename + scenario

After this, `range42-context use <codename> <scenario>` works.

#### The 5 repos cloned on the deployer-cli

| Repo | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `range42` | Main repo. Wizard, 11 Ansible roles, 3 playbooks, the `range42-context` shell tool. |
| `range42-playbooks` | Lab scenarios (demo\_lab, blank\_scenario\_\*). What gets deployed on the Proxmox VMs. |
| `range42-catalog` | Reusable Ansible roles (firewalls, packages, dotfiles, wazuh, etc.) used by scenarios. |
| `range42-ansible_roles-proxmox_controller` | Wraps the Proxmox API (create/clone/delete VMs, manage templates, networks). |
| `range42-ansible_roles-debug-devkit` | Helper scripts for snapshots, reverts, debugging individual VMs. |

## Step 8 — Deploy the scenario itself

This isn't a wizard step — you run it manually after the wizard finishes.

### 8a. Load your context

Open a new terminal (or `source ~/.zshrc` in the current one), then load the workspace you just created:

```bash
range42-context use YOUR_CODENAME_INFRASTRUCTURE blank_scenario_2_subnets
```

You should see `range42-context` switch into the workspace, with output like this:

```
----[ switching to px-testing-blank_scenario_2_subnets ]----

    ➜ commented all active Include lines
    ➜ uncommented Include for px-testing-blank_scenario_2_subnets
    ➜ commented all sourced_range42.sh in .zshrc
    ➜ uncommented sourced_range42.sh for px-testing-blank_scenario_2_subnets in .zshrc
    ➜ sourced /home/grml/range42.config/px-testing-blank_scenario_2_subnets/sourced_range42.sh
    ➜ updated secrets symlink in devkit → px-testing-blank_scenario_2_subnets
    ➜ updated secrets symlink in playbooks → px-testing-blank_scenario_2_subnets
    ➜ exported RANGE42_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE=/home/grml/range42.config/px-testing-blank_scenario_2_subnets/secrets/vault_pass.txt
    ➜ exported ANSIBLE_CONFIG=/home/grml/range42/range42/ansible.cfg
    ✓ ssh keys reloaded (3 key(s) loaded)

    --- status : px-testing-blank_scenario_2_subnets ---

    workspace        px-testing-blank_scenario_2_subnets  ok
    vault pass       vault_pass.txt                       ok
    vault            encrypted                            ok
    vault decrypt    password valid                       ok
    ssh-agent        3 key(s) loaded                      ok
    inventory        inventory_default.yml                ok
    scenario         blank_scenario_2_subnets             ok
```

If every line of the status block ends with `ok`, the workspace is loaded correctly and you're ready to deploy. If anything is `ko`, see [Troubleshooting](../operations/troubleshooting.md).

### 8b. Deploy the scenario VMs

```bash
range42-context deploy    # ~15-20 min for first deploy
```

**Behind the scenes:**

1. Downloads cloud-init images (Ubuntu Noble, Server, Debian 12) to Proxmox storage
2. Creates 9 VM templates (nano, micro, small, medium, large) on `vmbr140`
3. For each of 4 team VMs:
   - Clones template (small, vm\_id 9221) to a new VM
   - Sets cloud-init variables (user, password, SSH key, IP, gateway, bridge)
   - Starts the VM
   - Waits for SSH and cloud-init completion
4. On all 4 VMs:
   - Installs basic packages (vim, htop, net-utils)
   - Installs dotfiles for `alice` user
   - Configures UFW firewall (port 22 only)

When deploy completes, SSH into a VM:

```bash
ssh r42.bs2-team-143-01
```

You're now `alice@bs2-team-143-01`. From here you can ping the other 3 VMs
(`192.168.143.201`, `192.168.144.200`, `192.168.144.201`) and reach the internet
(NAT routes through `vmbr0`).

:::note

range42 generated **both** the Ansible inventory and your `~/.ssh/config` for
you. SSH keys are loaded automatically when you run `range42-context use`. No
manual SSH key import or `-i keyfile` flag needed — just `ssh r42.<vm-name>`.
